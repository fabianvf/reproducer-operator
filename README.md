## Reproducer Operator

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fabianvf/reproducer-operator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fabianvf/reproducer-operator)

Note: Build status should be failing, if it's succeeded it means we may have fixed the underlying issue!

Dummy operator for reproducing issues. Run `molecule converge -s local` to get into whatever the failing state of the day is.
